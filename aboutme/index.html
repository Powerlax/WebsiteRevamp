	<h1>All About Me</h1>
	<p>Hello! My name is Vishruth Rao, and I am a high school student. I am currently a freshman at Eastlake High School, and I am passionate about learning and exploring new things. I have a wide range of interests, including robotics, programming, astronomy/rocketry, math, reading, writing, running and playing music. I am also very active in my school and community. I am involved in several extracurricular activities. I am also a volunteer at my local child clothing donation center, and I try to help out in whatever ways I can. I am passionate about learning, and I always strive to do my best. I am confident that I will be successful in all of my endeavors, and I am excited to see what the future holds.</p>
