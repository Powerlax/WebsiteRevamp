		<p id="pianoCoverPara">I love to play the the piano! I have been playing the piano for 7 years now and I loved every moment of it. Although my piano teacher gives me many songs to work on, I love to challenge myself by recreating some of my favorite songs into piano covers! If you want to listen to some of them, please click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKf8l3YtIwUTPTRw1owCAyQ" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
